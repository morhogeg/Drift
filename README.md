# Drift - Intelligent Conversation Explorer

A sophisticated AI chat application featuring a unique "drift" capability that allows users to branch conversations and explore concepts in isolated, focused discussions.

## Overview

Drift transforms the traditional AI chat experience by introducing contextual branching. Select any text from an AI response to "drift" into a focused exploration of that specific concept, maintaining complete separation from the main conversation thread.

Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, Drift features a refined dark glassmorphic aesthetic with purple/pink gradient accents for an elegant, modern interface.

## Current Features

- **Push to Main**: Merge drift discoveries back into the main conversation with undo capability
- **Visual Indicators**: Purple gradient selection tooltip with drift emoji (ðŸŒ€)
- **Seamless Navigation**: "Go to Source" feature to return to the original conversation
- **Persistent Drift Chats**: Drift conversations are saved and accessible from the sidebar

### ðŸ’¬ Chat System
- **Dual AI Support**: Toggle between OpenRouter (cloud) and Ollama (local) models
- **Auto-Titling**: Conversations automatically generate titles from the first user message
- **Markdown Rendering**: Full markdown support with syntax highlighting for code blocks
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time streaming of AI responses
