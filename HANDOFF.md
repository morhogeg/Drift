**Date:** March 10, 2026
**Branch:** `main`
**Build:** 13 (incremented this session)
**Status:** Drift context fix. TypeScript clean. Synced to Xcode. Pushed.

---

## What Was Done This Session

### 33. Drift context — parent conversation now included (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** `contextMessages` prop was passed into `DriftPanel` but destructured as `_contextMessages` (prefixed underscore = unused). The system prompt had zero knowledge of the parent conversation, so drifting on "Shila" from a Tel Aviv restaurants list gave the AI no idea it was a restaurant.
- **Fix:** Removed the `_` prefix so `contextMessages` is used. Last 6 parent messages are now injected into the system prompt as labelled `User:`/`Assistant:` lines. The AI is instructed to answer in that context and not treat the selected text as ambiguous when the conversation makes its meaning clear. Falls back to the generic prompt when `contextMessages` is empty.

### 32. Scroll reliability (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** Missing `touch-action: pan-y` on scroll container and intermediate wrapper div; MultiModelCarousel outer wrapper had no touch-action, intercepting vertical scroll gestures
- **Fix:** Added `touch-action: pan-y` to `.chat-messages-container` CSS, the `absolute inset-0` wrapper div in App.tsx, and carousel outer wrapper. Inner carousel scroll div stays `pan-x`. Vertical scroll now works reliably anywhere in the chat.

### 31. Swipe left/right to open/close sidebar (NEW FEATURE)
- New `src/hooks/useSwipeGesture.ts` hook — 50px min horizontal, ≤0.5 vertical/horizontal ratio to distinguish from scroll
- Swipe left anywhere in main chat → open sidebar; swipe right → close
- Excludes touches starting inside `.multi-model-carousel` to avoid conflict with carousel swipe
- Wired into main chat container in App.tsx

### 30. Multi-model continue — only continued model responds (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** Classic React stale closure — `sendMessage` captured `selectedTargets` from last render; `continueWithModel` updated the store synchronously but React hadn't re-rendered, so old multi-model array was used
- **Fix:** `sendMessage` now reads `useModelStore.getState().selectedTargets` (Zustand escape hatch) at call time. Also fixed `setSelectedTargetsPersist` which was persisting a stale value.

### 29. Drift bottom bar — reliability overhaul (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause (multiple):**
  1. Regular AI messages missing `.ai-message` class entirely — tooltip's `anchorEl.closest('.ai-message')` silently bailed
  2. Drift push-back messages also missing `.ai-message`, and had `select-text` explicitly suppressed
  3. DriftPanel AI messages missing both `.ai-message` and `data-message-id`
  4. iOS `selectionchange` race: bar dismissed before selection committed after finger lift
  5. Selection handle drag only checked `anchorNode`, not `focusNode`
  6. Bottom bar z-index too low (9999)
- **Fix:** Added `.ai-message` + `data-message-id` to all AI message render paths (App.tsx, DriftPanel.tsx). Fixed `select-text` suppression. Added `touchActiveRef` + 400ms post-touchend dismiss suppression. Now checks both `anchorNode` and `focusNode`. z-index raised to 99997.

### 28. Single-model → retroactive multi-model carousel (NEW FEATURE)
- New `retroactivelyUpgradeToBroadcast()` helper: when user adds a model after a single-model exchange, assigns a new `broadcastGroupId` to the last user + assistant messages
- Both `onToggleTarget` handlers (ModelPillRow + ModelPickerSheet) now handle the single-model case: if no active broadcast group exists, upgrades the last exchange and sends to new model(s)
- Result: existing response + new response(s) appear as a swipeable carousel, exactly like a native multi-model broadcast

### 27. Model picker — light mode (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** `ModelPickerSheet.tsx` used hardcoded dark colors (`bg-[#0f0f18]`, `text-white`, `text-white/40`, `bg-white/5`) — invisible/ugly in light mode
- **Fix:** All colors replaced with theme-aware Tailwind classes (`bg-dark-surface`, `text-text-primary`, `text-text-muted`, `bg-dark-elevated`, `border-dark-border`) — adapts to both themes automatically

### 26. Scroll overlap in multi-model mode (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** Messages container `padding-bottom: 9rem` didn't account for multi-model mode which adds ModelPillRow (~48px) + "Replying to" label (~24px) ≈ 72px extra bottom bar height
- **Fix:** Padding-bottom is now dynamic: `12rem` when `selectedTargets.length > 1`, `9rem` for single model

### 25. User message not appearing after "Continue →" on mobile (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** `continueWithModel` set `activeCanvasId`, causing the user reply to get `canvasId` on send → filtered out by `if (msg.canvasId) return null`. The canvas section is `hidden md:block` (desktop only), so messages were invisible on mobile
- **Fix:** Added `isTouchDevice` detection in App.tsx; `setActiveCanvasId` is now skipped on mobile so replies flow normally into the main message thread

### 24b. Drift bottom bar — redesign (UX)
- Full redesign of the iOS selection bottom bar (`SelectionTooltip.tsx` touch path)
- **Before:** Hardcoded `bg-[#1a1a2e]`, `text-white/40` — broken in light mode, dated look
- **After:** `bg-dark-surface/95 backdrop-blur-2xl` (white in light, dark in dark) + layered shadow
- Added `3px` vertical pink→violet gradient accent bar beside text preview
- **Drift button:** full gradient + `shadow-[0_4px_14px_rgba(168,85,247,0.35)]` + `active:scale-95`
- **Save button:** `bg-dark-elevated + border-dark-border` — fully theme-aware
- Desktop tooltip also updated to same treatment (gradient Drift, ghost Save)

### 21. Single-model mode — remove purple dot (POLISH)
- **Fix:** In `ModelPillRow.tsx`, the colored model dot is now hidden when only 1 target is selected. Shows only in multi-model mode where it helps distinguish models.

### 22. Multi-model carousel — swipe enabled (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** Outer `overflow-hidden` wrapper was creating a clipping context that blocked iOS touch-based horizontal scroll on the inner snap container
- **Fix:** Changed outer wrapper to `style={{ overflowX: 'clip' }}` (doesn't intercept scroll events); inner container changed from `overflowX: 'auto'` → `'scroll'`; added `touchAction: 'pan-x'` for explicit iOS gesture routing; `scrollSnapAlign: 'start'` for better snap feel

### 23. Continue button — moved below content (UX)
- **Root cause:** `absolute top-2 right-3` positioned the button overlapping the first line of text
- **Fix:** Button is now a flex row at the bottom of the card (`flex justify-end mt-3`), no longer overlapping content

### 24. Voice input — fixed (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** `Info.plist` was missing `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` and `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`. iOS silently denied `webkitSpeechRecognition.start()` with `not-allowed`, which was never shown to the user.
- **Fix:** Added both privacy keys to `Info.plist`. Added `toast.error()` display for voice errors so failures are visible. Installed `@capacitor-community/speech-recognition@7.0.1` as a fallback (Capacitor plugin, SPM-incompatible warning is benign — web speech path works).
- **⚠️ First launch after rebuild:** iOS will show a permission dialog for mic + speech. User must allow both.

### 19. Multi-model carousel — text overflow fix (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** `minWidth: '100%'` in a flex scroll container allows children to expand beyond viewport width — text spilled horizontally instead of wrapping
- **Fix:** Added `maxWidth: '100%'`, `min-w-0`, `overflow-hidden` on card and content divs so text wraps fully within the card, matching a normal single-model response

### 20. Drift bottom bar — restored (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** `SelectionTooltip` requires `.ai-message` class on the message element to know it's selectable AI content — the class was accidentally removed during the carousel restyle
- **Fix:** Re-added `ai-message` to the carousel card's content div; Drift + Save bottom bar works again on iOS

### 15. Multi-model carousel — frameless card design
- Removed the bordered card frame from each carousel card; each model's answer now renders as clean full-width content matching a normal single-model AI message
- Model label (colored dot + name) kept, positioned subtly above the content
- Pagination dots fixed for light mode: changed from `bg-white/15` (invisible on light bg) to theme-aware `bg-text-muted/30`

### 16. Retroactive model add
- When user adds a new model via ModelPillRow or ModelPickerSheet while an active broadcast group exists, the original user question is automatically sent to the new model
- Response is added to the same `broadcastGroupId` so it appears as a new swipeable card alongside existing answers
- Added `sendToTarget` helper that mirrors the broadcast dispatch switch-case for a single target

### 17. DriftPanel input — match main chat
- Moved mic button inside the textarea (was a separate external button to the right)
- Now uses `absolute right-2 bottom-2 flex items-center gap-1` container matching main chat exactly
- Button order: mic (when empty) → stop-generation → listening-stop → send
- Red glow overlay on listening state added
- Textarea `pr-24` to accommodate both buttons

### 18. Input field polish
- Inactive send button: removed grey background (`bg-white/[0.05] border border-white/10 opacity-40`) → just `text-text-muted cursor-default`, arrow visible without background
- Send button positioning: `bottom-2` via container (no more conditional `top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2`)
- Applies to DriftPanel; main chat was already using this style

### 11. Voice Input — Restart Fix (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** `recognition.onend` called `recognition.start()` on the already-ended instance → Chrome throws `InvalidStateError` → caught silently → mic dies after ~1ms
- **Fix:** `onend` now restarts via `startWebRef` (ref to `startListeningWeb`) after a 50ms delay, always creating a **fresh** `SpeechRecognition` instance
- Initial `start()` now wrapped in try/catch to surface real errors instead of silent failure
- Mic now stays live across silence gaps as intended

### 12. Model Picker — Light Mode Visibility (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** `ModelPillRow` used `text-white / border-white/10 / text-white/40` — invisible against light-mode background (`rgb(242 242 247)`)
- **Fix:** Replaced with theme-aware classes: `text-text-primary`, `text-text-muted`, `border-dark-border/60`
- Pill ✕ label also updated from `text-white/30` → `text-text-muted`

### 13. Model Selection — Toggle Revert Bug (BUG FIX)
- **Root cause:** `onToggleTarget` called `modelStore.toggleTarget(target)` then immediately `setSelectedTargetsPersist(modelStore.selectedTargets)` — but `modelStore.selectedTargets` is the stale pre-render snapshot, so `setSelectedTargets(old_value)` **undid every toggle**
- **Fix:** Compute next target list locally from current render's `selectedTargets` and call `setSelectedTargetsPersist(next)` directly — applied to both ModelPillRow and ModelPickerSheet handlers

### 14. Continue → Button — Gemini Cases (BUG FIX)
- `continueWithModel` previously had no cases for Gemini models — clicking "Continue →" on a Gemini broadcast card did nothing
- Added `Gemini Flash Lite` / `gemini-flash-lite` and `Gemini Flash` / `gemini-flash` cases

## Previous Sessions (1-10)
### 7. Mobile Multi-Model Chat (NEW)
- **Model pills row** — horizontal scrollable chips above the textarea (mobile-only, `lg:hidden`)
- **"+ Add model"** chip opens a **ModelPickerSheet** bottom sheet (slide-up) to select up to 3 models
- **Swipeable card carousel** — `MultiModelCarousel` component replaces the desktop grid on mobile; uses CSS `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory` for full-width per-model cards
- **Pagination dots** — tappable dots below the carousel show current card position
- **"Replying to: X"** label above textarea updates live as user swipes between model cards
- **"Continue →"** button on each card (appears when broadcast is active and response is ready)
- **Demo AI model** — wired in as `dummy-lite` target; streams word-by-word with 30-50ms delay
- Desktop (md+) keeps the existing 2-column grid unchanged

### 8. iOS Drift Text Selection Fix
- On touch/iOS devices, the tooltip no longer tries to appear above the selection (conflicts with native iOS copy menu)
- Instead: a **persistent bottom bar** appears fixed at the bottom of screen with selected text preview + Save + Drift buttons
- Touch events isolated from mouse events — touch path fires at 150ms; selectionchange debounce 200ms
- Bottom bar stays visible after native iOS menu dismisses; hides only when selection is cleared

### 9. ChatGPT-Style Input Field
- Both mic and send buttons now live **inside** the textarea, right edge
- **Empty state**: mic icon + dimmed send visible inside field
- **Typing state**: mic hidden, send glows pink→violet gradient
- **Voice listening state**: red ring on field border + pulsing red stop button

### 10. Voice Input — Toggle Fix (superseded by session 11)
- Tap-to-speak / tap-to-stop; `isListeningRef` pattern; three-tier fallback

### 1–6. Previous Sessions
1. AI Reply Design — containerless, full width
2. DriftPanel iOS keyboard fix
3. Sidebar wider (85vw/340px)
4. Input field placement in long chats
5. Design polish — Claude/Gemini feel
6. Voice input (Web Speech API) — initial implementation

## What's Pending / Next Ideas

- [ ] **TestFlight submission** — archive build 12 in Xcode → upload to App Store Connect. ⚠️ First launch after install will prompt for mic + speech recognition permissions — user must allow both for voice to work.
- [ ] **Real model for multi-model** — add more real models to ModelPickerSheet's ALL_MODELS list (Gemini Flash 2.5, etc.)
- [ ] **Light theme color polish** — some hardcoded dark hex colors remain in App.tsx/DriftPanel.tsx (e.g. `bg-[#0d0d12]`, `bg-[#0a0a0a]`)
- [ ] **Message editing** — click to edit a sent message, regenerate the AI response
- [ ] **Message regeneration** — re-run the last AI response
- [ ] **Real auth** — Supabase Auth or Firebase Auth (Login screen is currently a placeholder)
- [ ] **Code block copy button** — syntax highlighted blocks lack a copy button
- [ ] **Multi-level drift** — drift from inside a drift conversation
- [ ] **App.tsx refactor** — still ~2430 lines, could extract more hooks
- [ ] **Voice output** — TTS read-back of AI responses
